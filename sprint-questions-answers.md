1.  What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

        ☺  The difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website are one is predefined screen size (adaptive website), so it won't be able to fit on other      screen size device and other (responsive website) provides multiple screen size to fit all devices. 

2.  Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

        ☺  Mobile first means start with smallest view then up to largest view. And as for desktop first means that it start with the largest view then down to smallest view.

3.  What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

        ☺  It let us convert pixel size to rem easily, 16px = 1 rem

4.   How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

        ☺  Preprocessing is a new way to organize and help maintain readability to your CSS styles. As your web pages grow larger, you will have a lot of lines of CSS code and      that will be too confusing. So preprocessors are a tool to help and maintain your website styles.

5.  What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

        ☺  My favorite concept right now is nesting because you can mirror your HTML file and your styling. It helps me track my selectors and organize my styles.
           The concept that gives me the most trouble is mixins because I don't know what I will need as a mixin (In a project) because I didn't write the code.


The End.
